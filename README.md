# Weather App
This app was created to learn how to use webpack, bootstrap and classes 

## API
API got from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) website.

## Comments:
Design is meh, doesn't work perfectly, still needs some fixes (setUnit not working properly and visible api key). Working towards this and cleaner code
